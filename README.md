# Neural Networks
Neural Networks applications and functionalities.

# Summary
I created this repository to share some of the Neural Network knowledge that I've been acquiring in my studies.

Each folder in this repository will contain a different approach and funcionality for the NNs.


## Binary Classification
>A basic neural network introduction for a **Binary Classification** problem.
>
>Binary Classification problems are usually a task to identify in which of the two groups an element belongs to. It is usually
>interpreted as a boolean problem where the outcomes can be True/False or 1/0.

## Image Multiclass Classification
>A Neural Network **Inception** from VGG16 + dense layers creation for **Image Multiclass Classification**.
>
>Multiclass Classification problems consist in classifying an element into one of three or more groups.
>
>Those problems are more complex than the Binary Classification due to its multiples outcomes.
>
>NN Inception will also be approached in this notebook as well as image manipulation in python.

## Residual Neural Network
> A **Residual** Neural Network to **recreate nose into humans faces**.
>
> A Complex Network was built and trained with human faces with their noses covered
> so it could recreate them.
>
> Residual NN will be used in this notebook.

## NLP with Recurrent Neural Network
>
> A **Recurrent Neural Network** for **Natural Language Processing** the IMDB movies review.
>
> A Network was developed to learn the sentiment contained into the reviews written by the movie viewers.
