# NeuralNetworks
Neural Networks applications and functionalities.

# Summary
I created this repository to share some of the Neural Network knowledge that I've been acquiring in my studies.

Each folder in this repository will contain a different approach and funcionality for the NNs.

## Binary Classification
>A basic neural network introduction for a **Binary Classification** problem.
>
>Binary Classification problems are usually a task to identify in which of the two groups an element belongs to. It is usually
>interpreted as a boolean problem where the outcomes can be True/False or 1/0.

## Image Multiclass Classification
>A Neural Network *inception* from VVG16 + dense layers creation for *Image Multiclass Classification*.
>
>Multiclass Classification problems consist in classifying an element into one of three or more groups.
>Those problems are more complex than the Binary Classification due to its multiples outcomes.
